# WizardDuelGame

Fan-made recreation of the turn-based, collectible card game-style combat system in Wizard101. While the primary purpose of this project is to hone my gamedev skills, I am hoping to make it playable between multiple real people akin to Pokemon Showdown.

## Version 0.0.1 - Base Design

On this version, mostly design work is done - diagrams and very high-level game object design concepts.
Gathered research on most forseeable features in the game.
